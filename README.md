ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Logan.

I'm a software developer and university student from California.

I like artificial intelligence, web development, and all things software development.

Most of my largest repositories and projects are private, but if you'd like to see what I've worked on, just ask!

LoganBrinsmead/LoganBrinsmead is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
